# 🚀 GH_TSD  
**Grasshopper Components for Tekla Structural Designer**  

![GH_TSD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grasshopper-Tekla_Structural_Designer-blue?style=flat-square)  
A **powerful** and **flexible** Grasshopper plugin that connects **Tekla Structural Designer** with **parametric design workflows**. Supports **both pulling and pushing functions**, enabling engineers and developers to **fully automate and extend** Tekla's capabilities.

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Full API Integration** – Each component wraps a single API function, maintaining Tekla’s exact structure.  
✅ **Pull & Push Functions** – Unlike official plugins, GH_TSD enables **retrieving model data**, not just adding elements.  
✅ **Highly Customizable** – Build your own plugins on top of these components for **advanced automation**.  
✅ **For Developers & Engineers** – Designed for those who love **computational design and scripting**.

## 📖 How It Works  
GH_TSD acts as a **direct bridge** to the **Tekla Structural Designer API**, mirroring its structure and behavior.  
If you’re familiar with the **C# API documentation**, you’re already set—**that’s the manual!**  

- **Official plugins** mainly allow **pushing data** (e.g., adding members, loads).  
- GH_TSD allows **both pulling and pushing**, enabling deeper **programmatic access** to Tekla’s model and analysis data.  
- **Why does this matter?** Engineers can automate tedious tasks, optimize workflows, and leverage **Grasshopper’s parametric power** for structural engineering.

## 📦 Installation  
1. Navigate to https://github.com/Tatsuki0123/GH_TSD/tree/main/TSD_API_ver101/bin/Debug/net48  
2. DownLoad all files inside this folder.
3. UnZip it and put all into Grasshopper Component Folder
4. UnLock the all files (Right Click all files one by one and go Properties and unlock)
5. Use NetFrameWork instead of Net7(Core) in Rhino Grasshopper. (If this plugins not appear, type "SetDotNetRuntime" in Rhino command and change it into NetFrameWork)
    -> This is because TSD API only works on Dot Net Framework, not Dot Net Core

## 🎯 Who Should Use This?  
- 🏗️ **Structural Engineers** – Automate model interactions, extract results, and optimize workflows.  
- 💻 **Computational Designers** – Seamlessly connect parametric modeling with structural analysis.  
- 🛠️ **Developers** – Extend and integrate **Tekla Structural Designer** into custom workflows.  

---

## 📚 Documentation & Support  
- **Tekla API Documentation** – Since GH_TSD mirrors Tekla’s API, refer to the **official API docs** for in-depth details.  

---

## 💡 Why GH_TSD?  
Official Tekla plugins are **limited**, only allowing users to **push data** into the model. But engineers often need **to extract, analyze, and manipulate model data** for:  
- 📊 **Custom Reports & Visualizations**  
- ⚡ **Automated Model Checking**  
- 🔄 **Seamless Data Exchange with Other Tools**  

GH_TSD **fills this gap**, giving you **total control** over Tekla Structural Designer inside Grasshopper.  

🚀 **Unlock the full power of parametric structural design today!**
