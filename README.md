# 🚀 GH_TSD  
**Grasshopper Components for Tekla Structural Designer**  

![GH_TSD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Grasshopper-Tekla_Structural_Designer-blue?style=flat-square)  
A **powerful** and **flexible** Grasshopper plugin that connects **Tekla Structural Designer** with **parametric design workflows**. Supports **both pulling and pushing functions**, enabling engineers and developers to **fully automate and extend** Tekla's capabilities.

---

## ✨ Features  
✅ **Full API Integration** – Each component wraps a single API function, maintaining Tekla’s exact structure.  
✅ **Pull & Push Functions** – Unlike official plugins, GH_TSD enables **retrieving model data**, not just adding elements.  
✅ **Highly Customizable** – Build your own plugins on top of these components for **advanced automation**.  
✅ **For Developers & Engineers** – Designed for those who love **computational design and scripting**.

## 📖 How It Works  
GH_TSD acts as a **direct bridge** to the **Tekla Structural Designer API**, mirroring its structure and behavior.  
If you’re familiar with the **C# API documentation**, you’re already set—**that’s the manual!**  

- **Official plugins** mainly allow **pushing data** (e.g., adding members, loads).  
- GH_TSD allows **both pulling and pushing**, enabling deeper **programmatic access** to Tekla’s model and analysis data.  
- **Why does this matter?** Engineers can automate tedious tasks, optimize workflows, and leverage **Grasshopper’s parametric power** for structural engineering.

## 📦 Installation  
1. Download the latest **GH_TSD** release from package Manager or main branch.  
2. Drag & drop the `.gha` file into **Grasshopper**.  
3. Start using **Tekla Structural Designer API** inside **Grasshopper!**

## 🎯 Who Should Use This?  
- 🏗️ **Structural Engineers** – Automate model interactions, extract results, and optimize workflows.  
- 💻 **Computational Designers** – Seamlessly connect parametric modeling with structural analysis.  
- 🛠️ **Developers** – Extend and integrate **Tekla Structural Designer** into custom workflows.

## 💡 Why GH_TSD?  
Official Tekla plugins are **limited**, only allowing users to **push data** into the model. But engineers often need **to extract, analyze, and manipulate model data** for:  
- 📊 **Custom Reports & Visualizations**  
- ⚡ **Automated Model Checking**  
- 🔄 **Seamless Data Exchange with Other Tools**  

GH_TSD **fills this gap**, giving you **total control** over Tekla Structural Designer inside Grasshopper.  

🚀 **Unlock the full power of parametric structural design today!**
